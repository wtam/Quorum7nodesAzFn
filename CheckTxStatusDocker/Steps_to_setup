look at step 6 and run in Git Shell!!!!!!

https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/#step-1-setup

1. since I don't have the package.json, so I create it with
    npm init (note: with name checktxstatusdocker)

2 npm install  (note: to install all depedency)

3. npm start (note: if its fail wihtout startscript, change the package.json to  script to following

"scripts": {
    "start": "node your-script.js"
})

3. now I'm able to run and can start dockerize with setup a Dockerfile to tell Docker how to build a container image for our API:
    uses npm to install our modules and copies all of the files for our API into the container image.
    ------------------------------------------------
    FROM node:latest

    RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app  
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app  
    COPY . /usr/src/app

    EXPOSE 3000  
    RUN npm install  
    CMD ["npm", "start"]  

4. let's setup/create a Docker Compose configuration file 'docker-compose.yml' that will launch our API

5. docker-compose build (noted fail on windows vscode bash and powershell,But ok if run in Git Bash shell!! )

    checking only docker ps -a, docker version to see if docker is running

6. docker-compose up    [Note: if not able to run and find web3]
                        Run > npm install web3 --save, 
                        and then re-run> npm install --save module
                        then add the .dockerignore  [with modules/*]
                        docker-compose build  (run in the Git shell)
                        Then run docker-compose up  (in Git shell too!!!!)
docker ps -a or docker images to see what process is running

Clean up resources:
- docker-compose stop
- docker-compose down
- docker images
